Personal Dictionary - Bogdan's open source project

Ok, so... I am currently in process of learning Hungarian language (one of the most difficult languages to master due to low amount of interest in learning it => low amount of material to be found on the interwebs) and I am now trying to boost my number of words and phrases.

I found it that is much easier to just make a tool for myself to help me learn it.

If you find it useful, submit an issue with an idea or make a PR or even fork it...
